# Summary (in progress)

This repo contains notes made during my research into inheritance vs composition. I've been deep diving 
into the trade-offs of each after encountering a substantial issue after refactoring a project using 
inheritance with a project at work.

My goal is to gain a fuller and deeper understanding of the merits of both for future and existing projects
going forward.
